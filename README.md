  <h1>Abstract</h1>
  <p>Real-world applications can be potent tools in chemistry teaching, fostering highly beneficial learning for students. By involving students in real-world phenomena, we cannot only alter their perceptions of chemistry but also cultivate crucial chemistry competencies, preparing them for the future as scientists and citizens. In this report, we introduce the “Plastic Detective,” a citizen inquiry mobile app specifically designed to promote chemistry learning about the circular plastic economy. This app developed using a user-centered design approach, focuses on engaging young people in environmental science through active inquiry-based chemistry learning. The app allows users to participate in the investigation and monitoring of plastic waste, offering an interactive platform for data collection, analysis, and sharing. Its standout features include a responsive interface accessible on various devices, GPS-enabled geographical data mapping, photo evidence collection, and social media integration for data sharing and discussion. The findings of our study reveal that students of all educational levels responded positively to the app, with a significant improvement in their attitudes towards chemistry. This underscores the demand for and interest in such accessible technology. Our approach facilitates practical, real-life chemistry learning experiences and fosters a deeper understanding of circular plastic economy concepts.</p>
